Named after the iconic default WordPress theme in the early days, [Kubrick](https://wordpress.org/themes/default/) is a collection of React UI components to build WordPress admin interface with the classic styles.

## Why?

Many plugins create their own user interfaces that don't match the WordPress Admin styles, which can confuse users.

Even though there's an [ongoing effort to update the WordPress Admin UI](https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plans-ambitious-admin-ui-revamp-with-design-system-galvanizing-broad-support-from-the-developer-community), the classic editor is still widely used and may continue to be for years.

Kubrick UI bridges this gap with a set of React components that mimic the classic WordPress Admin styles. This helps developers with creating a consistent UI that feels like part of WordPress, which will not only improves the user experience but also saves developers time by removing the need to create custom styles for their plugins.

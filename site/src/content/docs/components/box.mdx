The `Box` component is a container commonly used in WordPress for metaboxes or widgets on the Dashboard. It comes with a title and content section and can also be collapsible, allowing you to hide or show the content. You can add various types of content to the box, such as text, forms, charts, or any valid React components and HTML elements.

## Usage

First, you need to import the `Box` from the package:

```jsx
import { Box } from '@syntatis/kubrick';
```

Then, to use it in your application, you'll need to provide a `title` for the box and the content as its `children`. The content can be a string, any valid HTML elements, or React components.

```jsx
<Box title="Site Health Status">
	<p>
		Your site has a critical issue that should be addressed
		as soon as possible to improve its performance and
		security.
	</p>
</Box>
```

### Collapsible

As mentioned, you can make the `Box` component collapsible. You can do this by adding the `collapsible` prop. This will add a toggle button to the header section that you can click to hide or show the content.

```jsx {3}
<Box
	title="Site Health Status"
	collapsible
	>
	<p>
		Your site has a critical issue that should be addressed
		as soon as possible to improve its performance and
		security.
	</p>
</Box>
```

### Footer

You can also add a footer to the box by using the `footer` prop. Though you can add any valid element or content on the footer section, it is particularly useful for adding buttons or other related type of actions.

```jsx {3}
<Box
	title="Site Health Status"
	footer={<Button variant="secondary">Refresh</Button>}
	>
	<p>
		Your site has a critical issue that should be addressed
		as soon as possible to improve its performance and
		security.
	</p>
</Box>
```

## Styles

<ClassesTable
	component='Box'
	prefix='kubrick-Box-'
	items={[
		{ selector: 'root', description: 'The root element of the box.' },
		{ selector: 'header', description: 'The header containing the title and toggle.' },
		{ selector: 'title', description: 'The title of the box.' },
		{ selector: 'content', description: 'The main content area of the box.' },
		{ selector: 'footer', description: 'The footer section of the box.' },
	]}
/>

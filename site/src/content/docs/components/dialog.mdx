The `Dialog` component is used to display a modal dialog box. In WordPress, it is commonly found when uploading media plugin, or theme. But you can use it to display any content that should appear on top of the main page content.

## Usage

To use the `Dialog` component, start by importing the necessary components: `Dialog`, `DialogTrigger`, and a trigger component like `Button` to open the dialog.

```jsx
import { Dialog, DialogTrigger, Button } from '@syntatis/kubrick';
```

Next, place the `Button` inside the `DialogTrigger` component. Then, use the `render` prop of `DialogTrigger` to pass in the `Dialog` component along with the title and any content you want to display in the dialog, for example:

```jsx {3}
<DialogTrigger
	render={() => {
		return <Dialog title="Hello World"><p>Hi, there...</p></Dialog>;
	}}>
  <Button>Open Dialog</Button>
</DialogTrigger>
```

### Footer

You can add a footer to the dialog by passing a `footer` prop to the `Dialog` component. Similar to the `Dialog` component, the footer section can contain any content you want, but this section is particularly useful for adding actions that the user can take, such as saving or closing the dialog.

```jsx {6}
<DialogTrigger
	render={() => {
		return (
			<Dialog
				title="Hello World"
				footer={(close) => <Button onPress={close}>Cancel</Button>}
				>
				<p>Hi, there...</p>
			</Dialog>
		);
	}}>
  <Button>Open Dialog</Button>
</DialogTrigger>
```

## Styles

The `Dialog` component comes with a few static selectors, prefixed with `.kubrick-Dialog-`, that you can use to select and customize the component and its elements.

<div className="table-classes">
| Selector | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `modal`   | The modal overlay.                 |
| `root`    | The root element of the dialog.    |
| `header`  | The header section of the dialog.  |
| `title`   | The title of the dialog.           |
| `content` | The content section of the dialog. |
| `footer`  | The footer section of the dialog.  |
</div>

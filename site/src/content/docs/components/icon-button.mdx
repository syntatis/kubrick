The `IconButton` component is used to render a button with an icon as the content. It works like to the `Button` component. It has the variations and the sizes, except the size will always has a 1:1 ratio. It is typically used when space is or may be limited such as in a toolbar, a dialog, or a navigation.

## Usage

To use the `IconButton` component, import it from the package package. You will also need an icon library for the icon. We recommend the official WordPress icon component [`@wordpress/icons`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-icons/) to add the icon.

```jsx
import { Icon, cloudUpload } from '@wordpress/icons';
import { IconButton } from '@syntatis/kubrick';

<IconButton label="Upload">
	<Icon icon={cloudUpload} />
</IconButton>
```

<Aside type="caution">
Since the button would only show an icon, you will need to provide the `label` prop to the `IconButton` component to make it accessible for the screen reader. The label will be added as the `aria-label` attribute for the button that will be read by screen readers.
</Aside>

Similar to the [the `Button` component](/components/button), the `IconButton` component will be rendered as the `button` type by default. You can change the type with the `type` prop, for example, to render it as a `submit` button:

```jsx {3}
<IconButton
	label="Upload"
	type="submit"
	>
	<Icon icon={cloudUpload} />
</IconButton>
```

You can also make it disabled with the `isDisabled` prop. This is useful when the button should not be clickable, for example, when the form is not valid or when the user does not have the right permission to perform the action.

```jsx {3}
<IconButton
	label="Upload"
	isDisabled
	>
	<Icon icon={cloudUpload} />
</IconButton>
```

### Variants

The `IconButton` component comes with different variants that you can choose from. The default variant is `primary`, but you can change it to `link`, `link-danger`, and `secondary` to match the button function.

```jsx {3}
<IconButton
	label="Upload"
	variant="secondary"
	>
	<Icon icon={cloudUpload} />
</IconButton>
```

### Sizes

Aside of the variants, the `IconButton` component also comes with different sizes that you can choose from. You can change it to `small`, `large`, and `hero` to match the significance or the surrounding sizes of the button.

```jsx {3}
<IconButton
	label="Upload"
	size="small"
	>
	<Icon icon={cloudUpload} />
</IconButton>
```

## Events

The `IconButton` component will emit an event when user interacts with it, such as when the button is clicked, hover, or when it receives focus. You can handle to these events by passing function to the following props on the component:

| Prop | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `onPress` | Triggered when the button is clicked. |
| `onHoverChange` | Triggered when the button is hovered. |
| `onFocusChange` | Triggered when the button receives or loses focus. |

Let's assume we have an app with an `IconButton`. When user hover the button, we want to change the icon. We can do this by using the `onHoverChange` prop, for example:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
	const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);

	<IconButton
		label="Upload"
		onHoverChange={setIsHovered}
		>
		<Icon icon={isHovered ? cloudUpload : cloudUploadAlt} />
	</IconButton>
}
```

## Styles

The `IconButton` component comes with a static selector, prefixed with `.kubrick-IconButton-`, that you can use to select and customize the component and its elements.

<div className="table-classes">
| Selector | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `root` | The root element of the button. |
</div>

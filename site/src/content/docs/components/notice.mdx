import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The `Notice` component is used to display a message to the user. It can be used to provide feedback, warnings, errors, or success message in your WordPress admin application.

## Usage

To use the component, import `Notice` from the package:

```jsx
import { Notice } from '@syntatis/kubrick';
```

To use it in your application, add the `Notice` component with the content, for example:

```jsx
<Notice>Settings saved.</Notice>
```

### Level

You can use the `level` prop to change the color of the notice bar. This is helpful when you want to indicate the significance of the message, such as whether it's an error, a warning, a success message, or just a general information.

The default value for the `level` prop is `info`, which means the notice is a general message. You can change it to `success`, `error`, or `warning` to reflect the appropriate message type, for example:

```jsx
<Notice level="success">
	Settings saved.
</Notice>
```

### Dismissable

Pass the `isDismissable` prop to the `Notice` component to make it dismissable. An **X** icon will appear on the side of the message. When the user click on the **X**, the message will disappear.

<Aside>
Keep in mind that the `isDismissable` prop doesn't save the state. So, when the user reloads the page, the notice will reappear.

You'll need to decide how your app should handle thisâ€”whether the notice should stay hidden or show up again after being dismissed. If you want it to stay hidden, you can save the user's choice using the [WordPress options](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/settings/options-api/) or [WordPress transients](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/transients/) API. You can then use the `isDismissed` prop to control the dismissed state. When set to `true`, the notice will remain hidden.

## Events

When the notice is dismissed, the component will emit an event. You can handle this event by passing a function as a callback to the following props:

| Prop | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `onDismiss` | Triggered when the notice is dimissed. |

## Styles

The `Notice` component comes with a few static selectors, prefixed with `.kubrick-Notice-`, that you can use to select and customize the component and its elements.

<div className="table-classes">
| Selector | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `root` | The root element of `Notice` component, `div` |
| `content` | The element that wraps the notice message |
| `dismiss-button` | The button to dismiss the notice |
</div>

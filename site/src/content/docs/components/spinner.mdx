The `Spinner` component is a loading indicator that you can use to show users that a process is in progress; the application is working on something, and they should wait for the process to complete.

## Usage

To use the component, import the `Spinner` from the package:

```jsx
import { Spinner } from '@wordpress/components';
```

Then, use it component in your application, as follows.

```jsx
<Spinner />
```

### Label

By default, the `Spinner` component will have the label **"loading"** provided for the screen readers. You can customize the label by passing the `label` prop with a new value.

```jsx
<Spinner label="Fetching posts" />
```

### Size

The `Spinner` component size is customizable. By default, it will be `24px` square. You can change the size by passing a number to the `size` prop.

```jsx
<Spinner size={48} />
```

## Styles

The `Spinner` component has static classes, prefixed with `.kubrick-Spinner-`. You can use these static classes to select and customize the component and its elements.

<div className="table-classes">
| Selector | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `root` | The root element of the `Spinner` component, an HTML `span` element. |
</div>

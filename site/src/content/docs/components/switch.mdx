The `Switch` component is a toggle switch that you can use to enable or disable a setting or feature in your application. It's especially useful to let users turn something on or off or when you have any binary option that users need to switch between.

## Usage

To use the component, import the `Switch` from the package:

```jsx
import { Switch } from '@syntatis/kubrick';
```

Then, you can use it in your application by adding the `Switch` component with the `label` prop to provide the label for the switch input:

```jsx
<Switch
	label="Show in REST API"
	name="show_in_rest"
	/>
```

### Selected

You can set the switch input to be selected by default by adding the `defaultSelected` prop to the `Switch` component. This will make the switch appear as when it's toggled on. Users will be able to toggle it off if they want.

```jsx {4}
<Switch
	label="Show in REST API"
	name="show_in_rest"
	defaultSelected
	/>
```

If you control the selected state through an external state or store, you can use the `isSelected` prop instead to set the selected state of the switch input:

```jsx {10}
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Switch } from '@syntatis/kubrick';

function App() {
	const [isSelected, setIsSelected] = useState(false);

	return (
		<Switch
			label="Show in REST API"
			name="show_in_rest"
			isSelected={isSelected}
			onChange={setIsSelected}
			/>
	);
}
```

### Disabled

You can disable the switch input by adding the `isDisabled` prop to the `Switch` component. This will disable the entire switch input. It will appear grayed out and users won't be able to navigate the input, interact or toggle the switch:

```jsx {4}
<Switch
	label="Show in REST API"
	name="show_in_rest"
	isDisabled
	/>
```

### Read-only

You can set the switch input as read-only by adding the `isReadOnly` prop to the `Switch` component. This will prevent the user from changing the switch state. The switch will still appear interactive, but users won't be able to toggle it.

```jsx {4}
<Switch
	label="Show in REST API"
	name="show_in_rest"
	defaultSelected
	isReadOnly
	/>
```

### Description

You can add a description to the switch input to provide more context to the user. You can do this by adding the `description` prop to the `Switch` component:

```jsx {4}
<Switch
	label="Show in REST API"
	name="show_in_rest"
	description="Enable this option to show the content in the REST API."
	/>
```

## Events

The `Switch` component will emit an event when the user toggle the switch input. You can listen to this event by passing a function to the following props:

| Prop | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `onChange` | Triggered when the user toggles the switch input on and off. The callback function will receive the new selected state as a boolean. |

## Styles

The `Switch` component has static classes, prefixed with `.kubrick-Switch-`. You can use these static classes to select and customize the component and its elements.

<div className="table-classes">
| Selector | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `root` | The root element of the `Spinner` component. |
| `input` | The element on the `Spinner` component that appears as the input. |
| `label` | The element that wraps the label text. |
| `description` | The element that wraps the description text. |
</div>

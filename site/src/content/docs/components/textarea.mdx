The `TextArea` component works like a standard HTML `textarea` element. It allows users to enter and edit multiple lines of plain text. This component is useful for collecting user input that requires more than one line of text in forms.

## Usage

To use the component, import the `TextArea` component from the package:

```jsx
import { TextArea } from '@syntatis/kubrick';
```

Then, you can use it in your application by adding the `TextArea` component with the `label` prop to provide a label for the `textarea`, additionally with the `name` prop to uniquely identify the textarea when on form submission:

```jsx
<TextArea label="Description" name="description" />
```

### Placeholder

You can add a placeholder text on the `TextArea` component by using the `placeholder` prop to provide a hint to users on what to enter in the `textarea`:

```jsx {5}
<TextArea
	label="Description"
	name="description"
	placeholder="Enter your description"
	/>
```

### Disabled

You can disable the `TextArea` component by adding the `isDisabled` prop. This will prevent users from interacting with the `textarea` and the input value will not be carried over on form submission:

```jsx {4}
<TextArea
	label="Description"
	name="description"
	isDisabled
	/>
```

### Read-only

You can make the `TextArea` component read-only by adding the `isReadOnly` prop. This will prevent users from editing the `textarea`, but the input value will still be carried over on form submission:

```jsx {4}
<TextArea
	label="Description"
	name="description"
	isReadOnly
	/>
```

### Rows

Similar to the HTML `textarea` element, you can customize the `TextArea` component by using the `rows` prop to define the number of visible text lines in the `textarea`. By default, the `TextArea` component uses the `5` rows. You can change it to the other number, for example:

```jsx {3}
<TextArea
	label="Description"
	rows={10}
	name="description"
	/>
```

### Cols

Similarly, you can also customize the `TextArea` component by using the `cols` prop to define the number of visible characters in a line in the `textarea`. By default, the `TextArea` component uses the `50` columns. You can change it to the other number, for example:

```jsx {3}
<TextArea
	label="Description"
	cols={30}
	name="description"
	/>
```

### Description

You can add a description to the `TextArea` component by providing a valid JSX element as the `description` prop. This section can be particularly useful for providing additional information or instructions to users:

```jsx {3}
<TextArea
	label="Description"
	name="description"
	description="Please provide a detailed description of the issue."
	/>
```

## Events

The `TextArea` component emits some events when users interact with the `textarea`. You can listen to these events by providing a function as callback on to the following props:

| Prop | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `onChange` | Emitted when the value is changed. The event handler receives the new input value as an argument. |


## Styles

The `TextArea` component has static classes, prefixed with `.kubrick-TextArea-`, that you can use these classes to select and customize the component and its elements.

<div className="table-classes">
| Selector | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `root` | The root element of the `TextArea` component. |
| `label` | The label element of the `TextArea` component. |
| `textarea` | The `textarea` element of the `TextArea` component. |
| `description` | The wrapper element of the description content. |
</div>

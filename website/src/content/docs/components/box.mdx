	The `Box` component is a container commonly used in WordPress for metaboxes or
	widgets on the Dashboard. It comes with a title and content section and can
	be set to be collapsible, allowing you to hide or show the content. You can add
	various types of content to the box, such as text, forms, charts, or any valid
	React components and HTML elements.

		quality="max"
	/>

## Usage

First, you need to import the `Box` from the package:

```jsx
import { Box } from "@syntatis/kubrick";
```

Then, to use it in your application, you'll need to provide a `title` for the box and the content as its `children`. The content can be a string, any valid HTML elements, or React components.

```jsx
<Box title="Site Health">
	<p>
		Your site has a critical issue that should be addressed as soon as possible
		to improve its performance and security.
	</p>
</Box>
```

### Collapsible

As mentioned, you can make the `Box` component collapsible. You can do this by adding the `collapsible` prop. This will add a toggle button to the header section that you can click to hide or show the content.

```jsx {3}
<Box
	title="Site Health"
	collapsible
>
	<p>
		Your site has a critical issue that should be addressed as soon as possible
		to improve its performance and security.
	</p>
</Box>
```

### Footer

You can also add a footer section to the box by adding the `footer` prop. Though you can add any valid element or content on the footer section, the `footer` section is particularly useful for adding buttons or other related type of actions.

```jsx {3}
<Box
	title="Site Health"
	footer={<Button variant="secondary">Check again</Button>}
>
	<p>
		Your site has a critical issue that should be addressed as soon as possible
		to improve its performance and security.
	</p>
</Box>
```

## Styles

<Table
	variant="classes"
	component="Box"
	items={[
		["root", "The root element of the box."],
		["header", "The header section containing the title and toggle button."],
		["title", "The wrapper element of the title."],
		["content", "The content section of the box."],
		["footer", "The footer section of the box."],
	]}
/>

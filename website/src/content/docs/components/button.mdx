	The `Button` component is similar to the HTML `button` element, but with some
	additional features and flexibilities. You can use this component to allow
	users to trigger actions or events through clicks, touch, or keyboard input.

## Usage

To use the component, import `Button` from the package:

```jsx
import { Button } from "@syntatis/kubrick";
```

You can then add it to your app just like a regular HTML `button` element:

```jsx
<Button>Save Changes</Button>
```

### Type

By default, the `Button` component behaves like a standard HTML `button`. You can change the button type using the `type` prop, for example, to make it a `submit` button:

```jsx
<Button type="submit">Save Changes</Button>
```

### Disabled

To disable the button, use the `isDisabled` prop. This is useful when the button shouldn't be clickable, such as when a form is incomplete or the user lacks permission to perform an action.

```jsx
<Button isDisabled>Save Changes</Button>
```

<Aside>
	A **disabled** button is non-interactive. It will disappear from the tab order
	that users won't be able to interact with it using keyboard, and it won't emit
	any events.
</Aside>

### Variants

The `Button` component comes with different style variants, and can be customized using the `variant` prop. The default variant of the component is `primary`, but you can switch to `link`, `link-danger`, or `secondary` to suit the button's role.

```jsx
<Button variant="secondary">Create new</Button>
```

### Sizes

You can also choose from different button sizes. You can change it using the `size` prop to `small`, `large`, or `hero` following on the context or importance of the button.

```jsx
<Button size="small">View</Button>
```

### Affix

The `Button` components comes with `prefix` and `suffix` props to to allow you to add content before or after the button label. You can add any type of content, but typically you would use these props to add icons.

```jsx
import { Icon, edit } from '@wordpress/icons';

// Add an icon after the button label
<Button suffix={<Icon icon={edit} />}>
	Edit
</Button>

// Add an icon before the button label
<Button prefix={<Icon icon={edit} />}>
	Edit
</Button>
```

<Aside type="tip">
	The `@wordpress/icons` package is recommended for use in WordPress admin
	applications. You can also use Dashicons, which is already included in the
	WordPress admin interface. See the [Icons guide](/docs/guides/icons) for more
	information.
</Aside>

### Loading

You can add `loading` prop to show the button on the loading state. This is useful when the button triggers an action that requires some time to process.

```jsx
<Button loading>Please wait...</Button>
```

When the button is on the loading state, it will show a spinner and the button will also be disabled to prevent multiple clicks.

## Styles

<Table
	variant="classes"
	component="Button"
	items={[
		["root", "The root element of the button."],
		["prefix", "The wrapper element of the prefix content."],
		["suffix", "The wrapper element of the suffix content."],
		[
			"infix",
			"The wrapper element of the button label, when the prefix or suffix is present.",
		],
	]}
/>

## Events

<Table
	variant="events"
	component="Button"
	items={[
		[
			"onPress",
			"Triggered when the button is clicked. The callback function will receive the click event as an argument.",
		],
		[
			"onHoverChange",
			"Triggered when the button is hovered. The callback function will receive a boolean indicating if the button is hovered.",
		],
		[
			"onFocusChange",
			"Triggered when the button receives or loses focus. The callback function will receive a boolean indicating if the button is focused.",
		],
	]}
/>

Let's assume you have an app with the `Button` component to save or updates settings. When the user click on it, you want to show the loading state and disable the button to prevent multiple clicks.

You can achieve that by using the `onPress` prop to handle the click event and add the `loading` prop to show the loading state.

```jsx {18} collapse={8-12}
import { useState } from "react";

function SaveButton() {
	const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

	function handleSave() {
		setIsLoading(true);

		// Simulate the saving process...
		setTimeout(() => {
			setIsLoading(false);
		}, 3000);
	}

	return (
		<Button
			loading={isLoading}
			onPress={handleSave}>
			Save Changes
		</Button>
	);
}
```

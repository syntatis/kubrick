	The `Checkbox` component represents the HTML `checkbox` input element. You can
	use it to allow users to select an option. You can either use it as a
	standalone or as part of a group with [the `CheckboxGroup`
	component](/components/checkbox-group).

	/>
</Lead>

## Usage

To use the component, import the `Checkbox` from the package:

```jsx
import { Checkbox } from "@syntatis/kubrick";
```

You can then add it to your app by passing the `label` prop to provide a label for the `checkbox` input, additionally with the `name` prop to uniquely identify it on form submission:

```jsx
<Checkbox
	label="I agree to the terms and conditions"
	name="agree"
	/>
```

### Disabled

Similar to the standard HTML `checkbox` input element, you can also make the `Checkbox` component disabled by passing the `isDisabled` prop.

```jsx {4}
<Checkbox
	label="I agree to the terms and conditions"
	name="agree"
	isDisabled
	/>
```

<Aside>
	A **disabled** checkbox is non-interactive. It will disappear from the tab
	order, and users won't be able to interact with it using the keyboard. It
	looks **"grayed out"** and its value will not be sent when the form is
	submitted.
</Aside>

### Read-only

You can also set the input as read-only by passing the `isReadOnly` prop, which will prevent the user from changing the check state:

```jsx {3}
<Checkbox
	label="I agree to the terms and conditions"
	isReadOnly
	/>
```

<Aside>
	A **readonly** checkbox will allow users see the current state of the checkbox but prevents them from changing it. Even though users can't modify it, the checkbox will still be interactive. It will be included in the tab order, so users can navigate to it using the keyboard, and it will still trigger some events. Additionally, its value will be included when the form is submitted.

	This is useful when you want to display the checkbox's state to users without allowing them to change it, such as when they don't have permission to alter the setting.
</Aside>

### Description

Aside of the label, you can add a description to add more context or instructions for the users. You can do this by passing the `description` prop:

```jsx {3}
<Checkbox
	label="I agree to the terms and conditions"
	description="Please read the terms and conditions before checking this box."
	/>
```

### Value

The `Checkbox` component is not selected by default. This means that when the component is first loaded, the checkbox will appear _unchecked_. However, if you want the checkbox to be checked initially, you can use the `defaultSelected` prop. This is useful when you want an option to be pre-selected, like agreeing to terms or enabling specific settings by default.

```jsx {4}
<Checkbox
	label="I agree to the terms and conditions"
	description="Please read the terms and conditions before checking this box."
	defaultSelected
	/>
```

## Styles

<Table
	variant="classes"
	component="Checkbox"
	items={[
		["root", "The root element of the checkbox."],
		["label-content", "The wrapper element of the label content."],
		["description", "The wrapper element of the description."],
	]}
/>

## Events

<Table
	variant="events"
	component="Checkbox"
	items={[
		[
			"onChange",
			"Triggered when the check state changes. The callback function will receive the new check state as a boolean.",
		],
		[
			"onFocusChange",
			"Triggered when the input receives or loses focus. The callback function will receive a boolean indicating if the input is focused.",
		],
	]}
/>

Let's assume you have a `Checkbox` component and a button within your app. You want to disable the button until the user check the checkbox.

You can achieve that by using the `onChange` prop to handle the check state change event and update the button state accordingly. The `onChange` prop will directly pass the new check state to the function as a boolean, so you can directly use it to update the state as shown in the example above, for example:

```jsx {10}
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
	const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);

	return (
		<>
			<Checkbox
				label="I agree to the terms and conditions"
				onChange={setIsChecked}
			/>
			<Button isDisabled={!isChecked}>Submit</Button>
		</>
	);
}
```

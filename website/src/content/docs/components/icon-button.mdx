	The `IconButton` component is used to render a button with an icon as the
	content. It works like to the `Button` component. It has the variations and
	the sizes, except the size will always has a 1:1 ratio. It is typically used
	when space is or may be limited such as in a toolbar, a dialog, or a
	navigation.

## Usage

To use it in your app, import the `IconButton` from the package. You will also need an icon library for the icon. We recommend the official WordPress icon component [`@wordpress/icons`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-icons/).

```jsx
import { Icon, cloudUpload } from "@wordpress/icons";
import { IconButton } from "@syntatis/kubrick";

<IconButton label="Upload">
	<Icon icon={cloudUpload} />
</IconButton>;
```

<Aside type="caution">
	Since the button will only show an icon, you will need to provide the `label`
	prop to the `IconButton` component to make it accessible for the screen
	reader. The label will be added as the `aria-label` attribute for the button
	that will be read by screen readers.

### Types

Similar to the [`Button` component](/components/button), the `IconButton` component will behave as the `button` type, by default. You can change the button type using the `type` prop, for example, to render it as a `submit` button:

```jsx {3}
<IconButton
	label="Upload"
	type="submit">
	<Icon icon={cloudUpload} />
</IconButton>
```

### Disabled

You can also make the button disabled with the `isDisabled` prop. This is useful when the button shouldn't be clickable, such as when a form is incomplete or the user lacks permission to perform an action.

```jsx {3}
<IconButton
	label="Upload"
	isDisabled>
	<Icon icon={cloudUpload} />
</IconButton>
```

### Variants

The `IconButton` component comes with two variants, `primary` (default) and `secondary`, that you can choose from. You can use the `variant` prop change it to the `secondary` variant to match the button's role.

```jsx {3}
<IconButton
	label="Upload"
	variant="secondary">
	<Icon icon={cloudUpload} />
</IconButton>
```

### Sizes

Aside of the variants, the `IconButton` component also comes with different sizes that you can choose from. You can change it to `small`, `large`, and `hero` to match its significance or the surrounding sizes of the button.

```jsx {3}
<IconButton
	label="Upload"
	size="small">
	<Icon icon={cloudUpload} />
</IconButton>
```

## Styles

<Table
	component="IconButton"
	items={[
		["root", "The root element of the button."],
	]}
	/>

## Events

<Table
	variant="events"
	component="IconButton"
	items={[
		["onPress", "Triggered when the button is clicked. It receives the click event as an argument."],
		["onHoverChange", "Triggered when the button is hovered. It will receive a boolean indicating if the button is hovered."],
		["onFocusChange", "Triggered when the button receives or loses focus. It will receive a boolean indicating if the button is focused."],
	]}
	/>

Let's assume you have an app with an `IconButton`. When the user hover the button, you want to change the icon. You can do this by using the `onHoverChange` prop, for example:

```jsx {8}
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
	const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);

	<IconButton
		label="Upload"
		onHoverChange={setIsHovered}>
		<Icon icon={isHovered ? cloudUpload : cloudUploadAlt} />
	</IconButton>;
}
```

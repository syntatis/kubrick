	The `IconLinkButton` component is a special link that appears like the
	`IconButton` component. It's a mix of the `LinkButton` and `IconButton`
	components. It shares similar styles, sizes, and props as well as the link
	attributes like `href`, `target`, and `rel`. However, since it will display an
	icon, it will always keep the 1:1 ratio.

## Usage

To use it in your app, import `IconLinkButton` from the package. You will also need an icon library for the icon. We recommend the official WordPress icon component [`@wordpress/icons`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-icons/) to add the icon.

```jsx
import { Icon, download } from "@wordpress/icons";
import { IconLinkButton } from "@syntatis/kubrick";

<IconLinkButton href="/file.zip" label="Download">
	<Icon icon={download} />
</IconLinkButton>;
```

<Aside type="caution">
	Since the link would only show an icon, you will need to provide the `label`
	prop to the `IconLinkButton` component to make it accessible for the screen
	reader. The label will be added as the `aria-label` attribute for the button
	that will be read by screen readers.

<Aside type="tip">
	Please refer to our guide on [Icons](/docs/components/icon) for more
	information on how to use icons with the component in your app.

### Variants

The `IconLinkButton` component comes with different variations. The default variant is `primary`, but you can `secondary` to match the button function. To change the variation, use the `variant` prop.

```jsx {4}
<IconLinkButton
	href="https://wordpress.org"
	label="WordPress"
	variant="secondary"
>
	<Icon icon={wordpress} />
</IconLinkButton>
```

### Sizes

Aside of changing the component variants, you can also change the size to match the size of the surrounding elements or its significance. It comes with a couple of sizes, `small` (default) and `large`. To change the size, use the `size` prop.

```jsx {4}
<IconLinkButton
	href="https://wordpress.org"
	label="Download"
	size="small">
	<Icon icon={wordpress} />
</IconLinkButton>
```

## Styles

<Table
	component="IconLinkButton"
	items={[["root", "The root element of the link."]]}
/>

## Events

<Table
	variant="events"
	component="IconLinkButton"
	items={[
		["onHoverChange", "Triggered when the link is hovered. The function callback will receive a boolean value indicating if the link is hovered."],
		["onFocusChange", "Triggered when the link receives or loses focus. The callback function will receive a boolean value indicating if the link is focused."],
	]}
	/>

Let's assume you have an app with the `IconLinkButton`. You want to animate the icon when the button receives focus. To do this, you can use the `onFocusChange` event:

```jsx {12}
import { useState } from "react";
import { IconLinkButton } from "@syntatis/kubrick";
import { Icon, wordpress } from "@wordpress/icons";

function App() {
	const [isFocused, setIsFocused] = useState(false);

	return (
		<IconLinkButton
			href="https://wordpress.org"
			label="WordPress"
			onFocusChange={setIsFocused}
			className={isFocused ? "animate" : ""}
		>
			<Icon icon={wordpress} />
		</IconLinkButton>
	);
}
```

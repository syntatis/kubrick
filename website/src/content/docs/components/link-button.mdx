	The `LinkButton` component is similar to the `Link` component. It creates a
	`a` element, but it will appear like the `Button` component; it will have
	similar styles, variations, and sizes as the `Button` component.

## Usage

To use it in your app, import `LinkButton` from the package:

```jsx
import { LinkButton } from "@syntatis/kubrick";
```

Then, add it in your app as you would with a native HTML `a` element by passing the `href` prop and the label:

```jsx
<LinkButton href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</LinkButton>
```

Similar to the `Link` component, the `LinkButton` also inherits several native `a` element attributes, such as the `target` and `rel` attribute. You can pass these attributes as props directly to the component:

```jsx {3-4}
<LinkButton
	href="/page"
	target="_blank"
	rel="noopener noreferrer">
	WordPress
</LinkButton>
```

### Variants

The `LinkButton` component comes with a couple of variants. The default variant, is `primary`. You can use the `variant` prop to change the appearance, for example, to the `secondary` variant:

```jsx {3}
<LinkButton
	href="https://wordpress.org"
	variant="secondary">
	WordPress
</LinkButton>
```

### Sizes

Similar to the `Button` component, the `LinkButton` component also comes with a couple of sizes. You can use the `size` prop to change the button size to the `small`, `large`, and `hero` size, for example:

```jsx {3}
<LinkButton
	href="https://wordpress.org"
	size="large">
	WordPress
</LinkButton>
```

### Affix

To add any valid elements before and after the label, you can pass the `prefix` and `suffix` props to the `LinkButton` component . This may be useful if you need to show an icon or context for the link.

Let's assume you'd like to show an icon after the label to show that the link will open in a new tab. You can use the `suffix` prop, as follows:

```jsx {5}
<LinkButton
	href="https://wordpress.org"
	target="_blank"
	rel="noopener noreferrer"
	prefix={<Icon name={wordpress} />}
>
	WordPress
</LinkButton>
```

## Styles

<Table
	component="LinkButton"
	items={[
		["root", "The root element of the link."],
		["prefix", "The element that wraps the prefix content."],
		["suffix", "The element that wraps the suffix content."],
		["infix", "The element that wraps the link label when the prefix or suffix is present."],
	]}
	/>

## Events

<Table
	variant="events"
	component="LinkButton"
	items={[
		["onHoverChange", "Triggered when the link is hovered. The function callback will receive a boolean value indicating if the link is hovered."],
		["onFocusChange", "Triggered when the link receives or loses focus. The function callback will receive a boolean value indicating if the link is focused."],
	]}
	/>

Let's assume you have an app with the `LinkButton`. You want to animate the icon when the button receives focus. To do this, you can use the `onFocusChange` prop to listen when the component receives or loses focus state.

```jsx {9}
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
	const [isFocused, setIsFocused] = useState(false);

	return (
		<LinkButton
			href="/file.zip"
			onFocusChange={setIsFocused}
			className={isFocused ? "animate" : ""}
			suffix={<Icon icon={download} />}
		>
			Download
		</LinkButton>
	);
}
```

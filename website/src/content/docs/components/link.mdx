	The `Link` component represents the HTML `a` element. It is used to create an
	anchor element that links to another resource or page. It comes with a couple
	of variants. It can also be extended with a prefix and suffix to provide
	additional context, such as an icon or a badge.

## Usage

To use it in you app, import `Link` from the package:

```jsx
import { Link } from "@syntatis/kubrick";
```

Then, add it in your app as you would with a native HTML `a` element:

```jsx
<Link href="https://wordpress.org">Go to WordPress</Link>
```

The `Link` component inherits several native `a` element attributes, such as the `target` and `rel` attribute. You can pass these attributes as props directly to the component:

```jsx {3-4}
<Link
	href="https://wordpress.org"
	target="_blank"
	rel="noopener noreferrer">
	WordPress
</Link>
```

### Affix

You can use the `prefix` and `suffix` props to add element before and after the link label. This may be useful if you need to show icon or context for the link.

```jsx {5} collapse={3-4}
<Link
	href="/page"
	target="_blank"
	rel="noopener noreferrer"
	prefix={<Icon name={wordpress} />}
>
	WordPress
</Link>
```

## Classes

<Table
	variant="classes"
	component="Link"
	items={[
		["root", "The root element of the link."],
		["prefix", "The wrapper element of the prefix content."],
		["suffix", "The wrapper element of the suffix content."],
		[
			"infix",
			"The wrapper element of the link label when the prefix or suffix is present.",
		],
	]}
/>

## Events

<Table
	variant="events"
	component="Link"
	items={[
		["onHoverChange", "Triggered when the link is hovered. The function callback will receive a boolean value indicating if the link is hovered."],
		["onFocusChange", "Triggered when the link receives or loses focus. The function callback will receive a boolean value indicating if the link is focused."],
	]}
/>

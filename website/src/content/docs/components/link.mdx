The `Link` component represents the HTML `a` element. It is used to create an anchor element that links to another resource or page. It comes with a couple of variants. It can also be extended with a prefix and suffix to provide additional context, such as an icon or a badge.

## Usage

To use the component, import `Link` from the package:

```jsx
import { Link } from '@syntatis/kubrick';
```

Then, use it as you would with a native HTML `a` element:

```jsx
<Link href="/page">Go to page</Link>
```

The `Link` component inherits several native `a` element attributes, such as the `target` and `rel` attribute. You can pass these attributes as props directly to the component:

```jsx {3-4}
<Link
	href="/page"
	target="_blank"
	rel="noopener noreferrer">
	Go to page
</Link>
```

### Affix

You can use the `prefix` and `suffix` props to add element before and after the link label. This may be useful if you need to show icon or context for the link.

```jsx {5} collapse={3-4}
<Link
	href="/page"
	target="_blank"
	rel="noopener noreferrer"
	suffix={<Icon name={external} />}>
	Go to page
</Link>
```

## Events

The `Link` component emits some events when the user interacts with it, such as when it is on hover, or when it receives focus. To handle these events, you can pass function as a callback on to these props:

| Prop | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `onHoverChange` | Triggered when the link is hovered. |
| `onFocusChange` | Triggered when the link receives or loses focus. |

## Classes

The `Link` component comes with a static selector, prefixed with `.kubrick-Link-`, that you can use to select and customize the component and its elements.

<div className="table-classes">
| Selector | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `root` | The root element of the link. |
| `prefix` | The element that wraps the prefix content. |
| `suffix` | The element that wraps the suffix content. |
| `infix` | The element that wraps the link label when the prefix or suffix is present. |
</div>

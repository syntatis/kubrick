	The `Notice` component is used to display a message to the user. It can be
	used to provide feedback, warnings, errors, or success message in your
	WordPress admin application.

## Usage

To use it in your app, import `Notice` from the package:

```jsx
import { Notice } from "@syntatis/kubrick";
```

Then, you can add it in your app with the content, for example:

```jsx
<Notice>Settings saved.</Notice>
```

### Level

You can use the `level` prop to change the color of the notice bar. This is helpful when you want to indicate the significance of the message, such as whether it's an error, a warning, a success message, or just a general information.

The default value for the `level` prop is `info`, which means the notice is a general message. You can change it to `success`, `error`, or `warning` to reflect the appropriate message type, for example:

```jsx
<Notice level="success">Settings saved.</Notice>
```

### Dismissable

Pass the `isDismissable` prop to the `Notice` component to make it dismissable. An **X** icon will appear on the side of the message. When the user click on the **X**, the message will disappear.

<Aside>
Keep in mind that the `isDismissable` prop doesn't save the state. So, when the user reloads the page, the notice will reappear.

You'll need to decide how your app should handle thisâ€”whether the notice should stay hidden or show up again after being dismissed. If you want it to stay hidden, you can save the user's choice using the [WordPress options](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/settings/options-api/) or [WordPress transients](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/transients/) API. You can then use the `isDismissed` prop to control the dismissed state. When set to `true`, the notice will remain hidden.

	The `SearchField` component provides a simple way to add a search input field
	to your application. It works like a regular text input but is specifically
	designed for search functionality. The field includes an input area where
	users can type their search query, and it automatically adds a clear button so
	users can easily reset the search field with one click, making it quick and
	easy for users to clear out search terms and start a new search.

## Usage

To use it in your app, import `SearchField` from the package:

```jsx
import { SearchField } from "@syntatis/kubrick";
```

Then, you can use it in your app by adding the `SearchField` component with the `label` prop to provide a label for the search field:

```jsx
<SearchField label="Search" />
```

### Placeholder

You can also add a placeholder text to the search field by adding the `placeholder` prop, similar to how you would with a regular text input This text will appear in the input field when it is empty:

```jsx {3}
<SearchField
	label="Search"
	placeholder="e.g. WordPress..."
	/>
```

### Disabled

Similarly, you can disable the search field by adding the `isDisabled` prop to the `SearchField` component. This will prevent users from typing in the search field or submitting a search query:

```jsx {3}
<SearchField
	label="Search"
	isDisabled
	/>
```

### Read-only

You can also mark the search field as read-only by adding the `isReadOnly` prop. You don't particularly need to use this prop, but it can be useful if you want to display the search field without allowing users to change the query, for whatever reason:

```jsx {4}
<SearchField
	label="Search"
	value="WordPress"
	isReadOnly
	/>
```

### Description

You can also additional context or instruction to the search field by providing a description with the `description` prop. The description will appear as a small text will appear below the search field:

```jsx {4}
<SearchField
	label="Search"
	placeholder="e.g. WordPress..."
	description="Enter a keyword to search for posts, pages, or other content."
/>
```

Use `descriptionArea` prop to change the description placement area. The prop accepts two valid values `before-input` and `after-input` (the default). You can set it to `before-input` to place the description above the search field, right below the text label:

```jsx {5}
<SearchField
	label="Search"
	placeholder="e.g. WordPress..."
	description="Enter a keyword to search for posts, pages, or other content."
	descriptionArea="before-input"
/>
```

## Styles

<Table
	component="SearchField"
	items={[
		["root", "The root element of the component."],
		["label", "The wrapper element of the label."],
		["input", "The input element."],
		["description", "The wrapper element of the description content."],
	]}
	/>

## Events

<Table
	variant="events"
	component="SearchField"
	items={[
		["onChange", "Triggered when the input value changes. The function callback will receive the new input value as an argument."],
		["onSubmit", "Triggered when the user submits the search query. The function callback will receive the search query as an argument."],
		["onClear", "Triggered when the user clears the search field. The function callback will not receive any argument."]
	]}
	/>

Let's assume you have a `SearchField` in your app. You'd like to capture the value of the search field when the user submits the search query, and send it to an external endpoint. We can use the `onSubmit` prop to handle this event, for example:

```jsx {17}
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { SearchField } from "@syntatis/kubrick";

function App() {
	const [query, setQuery] = useState("");

	useEffect(() => {
		if (query) {
			// Do the fetch fetch();
		}
	}, [query]);

	return (
		<SearchField
			label="Search"
			placeholder="e.g. WordPress..."
			onSubmit={setQuery}
		/>
	);
}
```

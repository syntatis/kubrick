	The `Select` component works like the standard HTML `select` element, allowing
	you to create a dropdown menu with options for users to choose from. You can
	organize the options into groups, making it easier to manage and display
	related choices together, which is especially useful when you have a long list
	of options and want to group similar ones for a cleaner look.

## Usage

To use it in your app, import both `Select` and `Option` from the package:

```jsx
import { Select, Option } from '@syntatis/kubrick';
```

Then, add the `Select` component with the `label` prop to provide a label for the select field, and the `name` prop to define the name of the select field when submitting the form.

You will also need to provide the options by adding the `Option` components. Each `Option` component should have a `value` prop to define the value of the option.

```jsx
<Select label="Site Language" name="site_language">
	<Option value="en_US">English (United State)</Option>
	<Option value="id_ID">Indonesia</Option>
</Select>
```

### Disabled

You can disable the select field by adding the `isDisabled` prop to the `Select` component. This will disable the entire select field, and users won't be able to interact with it or select any options:

```jsx {3}
<Select
	label="Site Language"
	isDisabled>
	<Option value="en_US">English (United State)</Option>
	<Option value="id_ID">Indonesia</Option>
</Select>
```

### Selected

You can set the selected option by passing the `selectedItem` prop to the `Select` component with the value of the selected option. This will make the selected option appear as the default value when the select field is rendered:

```jsx {3}
<Select
	label="Site Language"
	selected="id_ID">
	<Option value="en_US">English (United State)</Option>
	<Option value="id_ID">Indonesia</Option>
</Select>
```

## Events

<Table
	variant="events"
	component="Select"
	items={[
		[
			"onSelectionChange",
			"Trigger when the user selects an option, or when the selection is changed. The callback function will receive the value of the selected option.",
		],
		[
			"onFocusChange",
			"Triggered when the select field receives or loses focus. The callback function will receive a boolean value indicating whether the select field is focused or not.",
		],
	]}
/>

Let's assume we have an app with a `Select` component, and we'd like to show an additional input when the user selects the **"Indonesia"** option. We can use the `onSelectionChange` prop to handle this event, for example:

```jsx {10}
import { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
	const [showInput, setShowInput] = useState(false);

	return (
		<>
			<Select
				label="Site Language"
				onSelectionChange={(value) => setShowInput(value === "id_ID")}
			>
				<Option value="en_US">English (United State)</Option>
				<Option value="id_ID">Indonesia</Option>
			</Select>
			{showInput && <input type="text" />}
		</>
	);
};
```

## Styles

<Table
	component="Select"
	items={[
		["root", "The root element of the component."],
		["label", "The wrapper element of the label."],
		["input", "The HTML select element."],
		["description", "The wrapper element of the description content."],
	]}
/>

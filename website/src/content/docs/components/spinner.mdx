	The `Spinner` component is a loading indicator that you can use to show users
	that a process is in progress; the application is working on something, and
	they should wait for the process to complete.

## Usage

To use it in your app, import the `Spinner` from the package:

```jsx
import { Spinner } from "@wordpress/components";
```

Then, simply add it in your app, as follows.

```jsx
<Spinner />
```

### Label

The default label provided for the screen readers will **"loading"**. You can customize the label by passing the `label` prop with a new value, for example to indicate what is being fetched:

```jsx
<Spinner label="Fetching posts" />
```

### Size

The `Spinner` component size is customizable. By default, it will be `24px` square. You can change the size by passing a number to the `size` prop.

```jsx
<Spinner size={48} />
```

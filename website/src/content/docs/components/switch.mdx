	The `Switch` component is a toggle switch that you can use to enable or
	disable a setting or feature in your application. It's especially useful to
	let users turn something on or off or when you have any binary option that
	users need to switch between.

## Usage

To use the component, import the `Switch` from the package:

```jsx
import { Switch } from "@syntatis/kubrick";
```

Then, you can use it in your application by adding the `Switch` component with the `label` prop to provide the label for the switch input:

```jsx
<Switch
	label="Show in REST API"
	name="show_in_rest"
	/>
```

### Selected

You can set the switch input to be selected by default by adding the `defaultSelected` prop to the `Switch` component. This will make the switch appear as when it's toggled on. Users will be able to toggle it off if they want.

```jsx {4}
<Switch
	label="Show in REST API"
	name="show_in_rest"
	defaultSelected
	/>
```

If you control the selected state through an external state, you can use the `isSelected` prop instead to set the selected state of the switch input:

```jsx {11}
import { useState } from "react";
import { Switch } from "@syntatis/kubrick";

function App() {
	const [isSelected, setIsSelected] = useState(false);

	return (
		<Switch
			label="Show in REST API"
			name="show_in_rest"
			isSelected={isSelected}
			onChange={setIsSelected}
		/>
	);
}
```

### Disabled

You can disable the switch input by adding the `isDisabled` prop to the `Switch` component. This will disable the entire switch input. It will appear grayed out and users won't be able to navigate the input, interact or toggle the switch:

```jsx {4}
<Switch label="Show in REST API" name="show_in_rest" isDisabled />
```

### Read-only

You can set the switch input as read-only by adding the `isReadOnly` prop to the `Switch` component. This will prevent the user from changing the switch state. The switch will still appear interactive, but users won't be able to toggle it.

```jsx {4}
<Switch
	label="Show in REST API"
	name="show_in_rest"
	defaultSelected
	isReadOnly
/>
```

### Description

You can add a description to the switch input to provide more context to the user. You can do this by adding the `description` prop to the `Switch` component:

```jsx {4}
<Switch
	label="Show in REST API"
	name="show_in_rest"
	description="Enable this option to show the content in the REST API."
/>
```

## Styles

<Table
	component="Switch"
	items={[
		["root", "The component root element."],
		[
			"input",
			"The element on the `Switch` component that appears as the input.",
		],
		["label", "The element that wraps the label text."],
		["description", "The element that wraps the description text."],
	]}
/>

## Events

<Table
	component="Switch"
	items={[
		[
			"onChange",
			"Triggered when the user toggles the switch input on and off. The function callback will receive the new selected state as a boolean.",
		],
	]}
	/>

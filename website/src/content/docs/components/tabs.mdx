The `Tabs` component helps organize content into sections, with each section represented by a tab. When a user clicks or selects a tab, the related content is shown, while the other tabs content is hidden allowing them to focus on the selected section. The `Tabs` component is especially useful when you need to present multiple categories of information or features.

## Usage

To use the component, import the `Tabs` and `Tab` components from the package:

```jsx
import { Tabs, Tab } from '@syntatis/kubrick';
```

Then, you can use them in your application by adding the `Tabs` component with the `Tab` components as its `children`. Each `Tab` component should have the `title` prop to provide the tab title and the `key` prop to uniquely identify the tab:

```jsx
<Tabs>
	<Tab key="general" title="General">
		<p>General settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="advanced" title="Advanced">
		<p>Advanced settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="help" title="Help">
		<p>Help and support</p>
	</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

### Selected

By default, the selected tab is the first tab in the list. You can set a different tab to be selected by adding the `defaultSelectedKey` and define the key of the tab you want to be selected.

```jsx {1}
<Tabs defaultSelectedKey="advanced">
	<Tab key="general" title="General">
		<p>General settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="advanced" title="Advanced">
		<p>Advanced settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="help" title="Help">
		<p>Help and support</p>
	</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

In this example, it will make the `advanced` tab appears as active and its content will be shown even though it's not on the first on the list and the user hasn't clicked on it yet. Users will still be able to select a different tab if they want.

### Disabled

You can add the `isDisabled` prop to the `Tabs` component to disable the tabs that will prevent users from interacting with them.

```jsx {1}
<Tabs isDisabled>
	<Tab key="general" title="General">
		<p>General settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="advanced" title="Advanced">
		<p>Advanced settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="help" title="Help">
		<p>Help and support</p>
	</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

Alternatively, you can add `disabledKeys` prop to the `Tabs` component to disable only specific tabs by providing an array of keys.

```jsx {1}
<Tabs disabledKeys={['advanced', 'help']}>
	<Tab key="general" title="General">
		<p>General settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="advanced" title="Advanced">
		<p>Advanced settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="help" title="Help">
		<p>Help and support</p>
	</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

## Events

The `Tabs` component will emit an event when user switch between tabs. You can listen to these events to perform actions when they occur in your application with the following props:

| Prop | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `onSelectionChange` | Triggered when the user switches between tabs. The callback function will receive the key of the selected tab as an argument. |

## Styles

The `Tabs` component has static classes, prefixed with `.kubrick-Tabs-`. You can use these static classes to select and customize the component and its elements.

<div className="table-classes">
| Selector | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `root` | The root element of the `Tabs` component. |
| `items` | The container element that wraps the tab items. |
| `item` | The element that represents a tab item. |
| `panel` | The element that represents the content panel of the tab. |
</div>

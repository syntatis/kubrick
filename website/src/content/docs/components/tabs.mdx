	The `Tabs` component helps organize content into sections, with each section
	represented by a tab. When a user clicks or selects a tab, the related content
	is shown, while the other tabs content is hidden allowing them to focus on the
	selected section. The `Tabs` component is especially useful when you need to
	present multiple categories of information or features.

## Usage

To use it in your app, import both the `Tabs` and `Tab` components from the package:

```jsx
import { Tabs, Tab } from "@syntatis/kubrick";
```

Then, you can add `Tabs` component with the `Tab` components as its `children` in your app as follows. Each `Tab` component should have the `title` prop to provide the tab title and the `key` prop to uniquely identify the tab:

```jsx
<Tabs>
	<Tab key="general" title="General">
		<p>General settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="advanced" title="Advanced">
		<p>Advanced settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="help" title="Help">
		<p>Help and support</p>
	</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

### Selected

By default, the selected tab is the first tab in the list. You can set a different tab to be selected by adding the `defaultSelectedKey` and define the key of the tab you want to be selected.

```jsx {1}
<Tabs defaultSelectedKey="advanced">
	<Tab key="general" title="General">
		<p>General settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="advanced" title="Advanced">
		<p>Advanced settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="help" title="Help">
		<p>Help and support</p>
	</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

In this example, it will make the `advanced` tab appears as active and its content will be shown even though it's not on the first on the list and the user hasn't clicked on it yet. Users will still be able to select a different tab if they want.

### Disabled

You can add the `isDisabled` prop to the `Tabs` component to disable the tabs that will prevent users from interacting with them.

```jsx {1}
<Tabs isDisabled>
	<Tab key="general" title="General">
		<p>General settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="advanced" title="Advanced">
		<p>Advanced settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="help" title="Help">
		<p>Help and support</p>
	</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

Alternatively, you can add `disabledKeys` prop to the `Tabs` component to disable only specific tabs by providing an array of keys.

```jsx {1}
<Tabs disabledKeys={["advanced", "help"]}>
	<Tab key="general" title="General">
		<p>General settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="advanced" title="Advanced">
		<p>Advanced settings</p>
	</Tab>
	<Tab key="help" title="Help">
		<p>Help and support</p>
	</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

## Styles

<Table
	component="Tabs"
	items={[
		["root", "The component root element."],
		["items", "The wrapper element containing the tab items."],
		["item", "The wrapper element that represents a tab item."],
		["panel", "The wrapper elements that represents the content panel of the tab."],
	]}
	/>

## Events

<Table
	component="Tabs"
	items={[
		[ "onSelectionChange", "Triggered when the user switches between tabs. The callback function will receive the key of the selected tab as an argument." ]
	]}
	/>

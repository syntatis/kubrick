	The `TextField` component works like a standard HTML `input` element. It
	allows users to enter and edit plain text. This component is useful for
	collecting user input in forms.

## Usage

To use the component, import the `TextField` component from the package:

```jsx
import { TextField } from "@syntatis/kubrick";
```

Then, you can use it in your application by adding the `TextField` component with the `label` prop to provide a label for the input field, additionally with the `name` prop to uniquely identify the input field when on form submission:

```jsx
<TextField label="Name" name="name" />
```

### Value

The `TextField` component works similar to the `input` HTML element. Value will be empty, by default. You can set a value on to the input with the `value` or `defaultValue` prop.

Generally, the `defaultValue` prop is the one you should use. It sets a default value, and allows users to change the value as they type in the input. The `value` prop should be used only when the value is controlled externally, such as on an external state.

```jsx {4}
<SearchField
	label="Name"
	name="name"
	defaultValue="John Doe"
	/>
```

### Disabled

You can disable the `TextField` component by adding the `isDisabled` prop. This will prevent users from interacting with the input field and the input value will not be carried over on form submission:

```jsx {4}
<TextField
	label="Name"
	name="name"
	isDisabled />
```

### Read-only

You can make the `TextField` component read-only by adding the `isReadOnly` prop. This will prevent users from editing the input field, but the input value will still be carried over on form submission:

```jsx {4}
<TextField label="Name" name="name" isReadOnly />
```

### Type

Similar to the HTML `input` element, you can customize the `TextField` component by using the `type` prop to define what kind of text input you need from users. By default, the `TextField` component uses the `text` type. You can change it to the other type such as the `password` and `email` type:

```jsx {5,10}
<TextField label="name" name="name" /> // Default type is "text".
<TextField
	label="Password"
	type="password"
	name="password"
	/>
<TextField
	label="Email"
	type="email"
	name="email"
	/>
```

### Placeholder

You can add a placeholder text on the `TextField` component by using the `placeholder` prop to provide a hint to users on what to enter in the input field:

```jsx {5}
<TextField label="Name" name="name" placeholder="Enter your name" />
```

### Description

You can add a description text below the `TextField` component by using the `description` prop to provide additional information to users:

```jsx {5}
<TextField label="Name" name="name" description="Enter your full name" />
```

By default, the description text will be displayed as a small text below the input field. You can change where the description text is displayed by using the `descriptionArea` prop. The `descriptionArea` prop accepts `before-input` and `after-input` (default) values. Set it to `before-input` to display the description text above the input field, right below the label:

```jsx {5}
<TextField
	label="Name"
	name="name"
	description="Enter your full name"
	descriptionArea="before-input"
/>
```

## Events

The `TextField` component emits when the users interact with the component, such as when adding or editing the input value. You can add a function as a callback on to these props to perform actions when they occur in your application.

| Prop       | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `onChange` | Emitted when the input value changes. The event handler receives the new input value as an argument. |

## Styles

The `TextField` component has static classes, prefixed with `.kubrick-Tabs-`. You can use these static classes to select and customize the component and its elements.

<div className="table-classes">
	| Selector | Description | | --- | --- | | `root` | The root element of the
	`TextField` component. | | `label` | The label element of the `TextField`
	component. | | `input` | The input element of the `TextField` component. | |
	`description` | The wrapper element of the description content. |
</div>

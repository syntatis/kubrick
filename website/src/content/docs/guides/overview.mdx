Named after the iconic WordPress default theme, [Kubrick](https://wordpress.org/themes/default/) UI is a React UI library built on top of [react-aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/). It's designed to help developers create consistent and accessible applications within the WordPress Admin interface.

## Why?

A common issue with many WordPress plugins is that they often create their own user interface and experience, which doesnâ€™t always align with the WordPress Admin styles. This can make the plugin's settings pages feel out of place.

While there is ongoing [effort to revamp the WordPress Admin UI](https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plans-ambitious-admin-ui-revamp-with-design-system-galvanizing-broad-support-from-the-developer-community), the classic editor and admin are likely to remain in use within the WordPress ecosystem for years to come.

Kubrick UI provides a consistent and accessible UI library that helps developers build applications on WordPress Admin screens that blend seamlessly with the native WordPress Admin styles. It simplifies the process of building these applications, allowing developers to use React instead of the [archaic WordPress Settings API](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/settings/settings-api/) combined with PHP templates. This shift enables the creation of more interactive and dynamic settings pages.

### On a Personal Note

While working on some projects, I found that creating UIs for WordPress Settings pages or Metaboxes is much more intuitive using React components. They're reusable and make it easier to create interactive interfaces.

So, _historically_, this project has been on my backlog for a couple of years that I could finally put together. Hopefully, this can also be useful for those looking for a similar solution.

Named after the iconic WordPress default theme, [Kubrick](https://wordpress.org/themes/default/) UI is a React UI library built on top of [react-aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/). It's designed to help developers create consistent and accessible applications within the WordPress Admin interface.

## Why?

WordPress plugins often create settings page with their own user interface and experience, which doesn't always align with the WordPress Admin styles.  This can make the plugin's settings page feel out of place within the admin area.

Kubrick UI is a collection of components designed to provide a consistent and accessible UI library. It helps WordPress developers build interactive settings pages, metaboxes, and other admin screens that blend seamlessly with **the classic WordPress Admin styles**.

Although there is ongoing [effort to revamp the WordPress Admin UI](https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plans-ambitious-admin-ui-revamp-with-design-system-galvanizing-broad-support-from-the-developer-community), the classic editor and admin are likely to remain in use within the WordPress ecosystem for years to come.

<Aside title="If, however,...">
Your application is built primarily for the WordPress block editor (Gutenberg), or the [Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/), and does not need to integrate with the classic admin screen, you might want to consider using the [@wordpress/components](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-components/) package instead.

### On a Personal Note

While working on some projects, I found that creating UIs for WordPress Settings pages or Metaboxes is much more intuitive using React components. They're reusable and make it easier to create interactive interfaces.

So, _historically_, this project has been on my backlog for a couple of years. I'm glad that it finally sees the light, and hopefully it can be useful for those looking for a similar solution.
